How to set up in Jenkins
========================

Prerequisite to running in Jenkins is having Git plugin installed, which allows
to check out the latest version of tests.

Prerequisites
-------------

* tests must run under user with sudo rights
* commented out "Defaults requiretty" in visudo

Creating a new job
------------------

* Choose a job name and select Build a free-style software project
* Under Source Code Management, choose Git and paste repository URL, in this case
    
    git@github.com:jrusnack/389-test.git

* Specify a branch you want to build, such as origin/master
* Add buildstep and choose Execute shell. Type command

    bin/engage.sh --output-directory output --junit-report-file junit.xml --sequential

This will set the output directory to "output" and set the name of JUnit report
file to junit.xml. Flag --sequential is necessary, as parallel execution is not
compatible with Jenkins. For details see 
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Spawning+processes+from+build

* Add Post-build action Publish JUnit test result report and in the Test report
XMLs field fill 
    
    output/junit.xml

Jenkins will look in the folder output for file junit.xml, which we specified
in the Build step.
